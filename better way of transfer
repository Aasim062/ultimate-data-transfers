#once you have implanted the g drive and mega acoounts using google api in terminal follow the following steps for better transfer
#Split-GDriveFiles.ps1
# Split-GDriveFiles.ps1
# This script splits a large file containing Google Drive file paths into smaller parts for concurrent processing.

# Initialize variables
$inputFile = "gdrive_files.txt"  # Input file containing the list of file paths
$outputBaseName = "gdrive_files_part"  # Base name for the output files
$splitFileCount = 15  # Number of parts to split the file into
$currentFileIndex = 1  # Index for the current output file
$lineCounter = 0  # Counter for the number of lines written to the current output file

# Get the total number of lines in the input file
$totalLines = (Get-Content $inputFile | Measure-Object -Line).Lines

# Calculate how many lines to write per split file
$linesPerFile = [math]::Ceiling($totalLines / $splitFileCount)

# Create a StreamReader for large file processing
$reader = [System.IO.StreamReader]::new($inputFile)

# Open a writer for the first split file
$writer = [System.IO.StreamWriter]::new("${outputBaseName}$currentFileIndex.txt")

# Read through the input file line by line
while ($reader.Peek() -ge 0) {
    $line = $reader.ReadLine()  # Read the next line
    $writer.WriteLine($line)  # Write the line to the current output file
    $lineCounter++  # Increment the line counter

    # If the current file reaches the required line count, move to the next file
    if ($lineCounter -ge $linesPerFile) {
        $writer.Close()  # Close the current output file
        $currentFileIndex++  # Increment the output file index
        if ($currentFileIndex -le $splitFileCount) {
            $writer = [System.IO.StreamWriter]::new("${outputBaseName}$currentFileIndex.txt")  # Open a new output file
        }
        $lineCounter = 0  # Reset the line counter
    }
}

# Close the last writer if it exists
if ($writer -ne $null) {
    $writer.Close()
}

# Clean up the reader
$reader.Close()

# End of script



####using this script you will get the texxt filles in the r clone folder you created now in that folder open the command prompt and enter the following command
rclone copy gdrive_magneto: --files-from=gdrive_files_part1.txt mega:Backup --transfers=16 --checkers=16 --progress
this command will help in the data transfer acoording to the divided data .
run the number of terminal acoording to the number you have divided the data (in this case it is 15) //remember to change the text file number
